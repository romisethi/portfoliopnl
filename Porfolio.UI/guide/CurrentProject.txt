Business Use Case: Flash PnL Calculation in Financial Institutions
Financial institutions, such as banks or investment firms, need real-time Profit and Loss (PnL) calculations for their assets, including equities, bonds, FX, and commodities. Traders and risk managers rely on instant visibility into gains and losses to make informed decisions, optimize investments, and mitigate financial risks.
A Flash PnL App provides immediate calculations, ensuring traders can react to market fluctuations effectively.

Workflow of the Flash PnL App
1. Market Data Ingestion
- Integrate market data providers' APIs to fetch real-time values for different asset classes.
- Vendors like Bloomberg, Reuters, Interactive Brokers, or Alpha Vantage provide APIs for stock prices, FX rates, and bond valuations.
- Azure Functions or Azure Logic Apps can be scheduled to fetch data in real-time.
2. Data Storage & Processing
- Store the ingested data in a high-performance database:
- Azure SQL Database (structured financial data)
- Cosmos DB (NoSQL for dynamic market feeds)
- Apply business logic to compute PnL based on asset value fluctuations.
3. PnL Calculation Engine
- Core logic computes PnL for assets using the following formula:
- [ PnL = (Current Market Price - Purchase Price) \times Quantity - Transaction Costs ]
- For Bonds, it includes interest rates, yield spread changes.
- For FX, it considers currency fluctuations against base currency.
- Azure Machine Learning can enhance calculations by predicting market trends.
4. Real-Time Monitoring & Alerts- Use Azure Event Grid to trigger notifications when PnL exceeds risk thresholds.
- Power BI or Azure Synapse Analytics for PnL visualization and dashboarding.
5. Risk Management & Compliance- Incorporate Azure Policy for governance and compliance.
- Use Azure Cognitive Services for sentiment analysis on financial news impacting PnL.
6. User Interface & Accessibility- Frontend: Web-based React.js or Angular UI for trader dashboards.
- Backend: .NET Core-based RESTful APIs hosted on Azure App Services.
